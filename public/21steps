<p>Why your morning routine should not contain 21 steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Your morning routine is a set of actions you perform each morning as soon as you wake up. At YouRoutines, we believe that consistency is the key to achieving long-term results. There is no point in completing a great morning routine once a year. You should be able to complete your perfect morning routine 365 days a year. However, in order to make this a reality, you &nbsp;have to be very careful not to overload it. Otherwise, you will not be able to execute your morning routine consistently, which will bring frustration rather than results. Be realistic about your schedule. Remember those days when you wake up later than usual and you&rsquo;re late for a meeting. Are you going be able to complete a 21-step morning routine on those days?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Some experts suggest that you must get up very early&mdash;like 5am or even earlier&mdash;to have the perfect morning routine. This sounds logical. After all, if you wake up earlier than other people, you have some time when nobody will disturb you and there is a high chance you can complete your perfect 21-step morning routine. While this approach may work for morning people (who, by the way, constitute a minority of the world population), it is not practical for people who are more active at late hours. Unfortunately, there is no silver bullet for everyone when it comes to routines. Thus, if you want to reach a new level of productivity, you need to design custom routines for yourself. Life is a continuous process of finding products and behaviors that fit you best where you are at every period in your life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore, rather than having someone else&rsquo;s &ldquo;perfect morning routine,&rdquo; we recommend that you have a minimal morning routine that you execute no matter what happens &mdash; even if you have a trans-Atlantic flight that takes off at 6 a.m. This routine should last under 10 minutes. Therefore, it should have no more than 10 actions that can be completed in less than a minute. Examples of such actions could be:</p>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>Make your bed.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>It takes seconds to make the bed. There&rsquo;s no point in not doing it if nobody is still sleeping in it.</p>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>Brush your teeth.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>You can use mouthwash if you need to save some time.</p>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>Drink a glass of water.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>Usually, you are dehydrated when you wake up. Drinking a glass of water is a good idea even if you have a limited amount of time.&nbsp;</p>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>Take your medicine.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>If you can take your prescription pills in the morning, it is a good idea to take them while you&rsquo;re drinking a glass of water.</p>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>Style your hair</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>Use dry shampoo and other styling products to save time here.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Apply your makeup.</li>
    <li>Use antiperspirant.</li>
</ul>
<p>It takes seconds to apply, so there&rsquo;s no point skipping it.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Apply any creams or transdermal drugs.</li>
    <li>Log your weight, blood pressure, or other vital health parameters.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Your weight, blood pressure, and other body parameters can deviate as the day progresses, so it is a good idea to take baseline measurements during your morning routine.</p>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>Send a nice message.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>It is a good idea to send a message to the people you care about. Just wish them a good and productive day!</p>
<p>&nbsp; These are all actions that cost little time but improve your day dramatically. For other beneficial actions that require more time, you can design separate routines and execute them right after your morning routine if you have time. Or, you can plan to postpone them until the evening or even the next day. Just don&rsquo;t postpone them until the next year! Although these principles sound more complicated than just training yourself to wake up at 5 a.m., they are not extreme, and there&rsquo;s a greater chance that you will be consistent with them. &nbsp;To perfectly tune such a system, you will need some additional tools because it can be difficult to turn your routine into a habit. Luckily, we live in a digital era, and you probably already have a smartphone to help you with this process. You can use simple note applications or, even bet</p>
