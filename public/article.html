The morning routine is a set of actions you perform each morning as soon as you wake up. At YouRoutines, we believe that consistency is the key to achieving long-term results. There is no point in completing a great morning routine one time in a year. You should be able to complete your perfect morning routine at least 365 days per year. So, you should be very careful not to overload it. Otherwise, you will not be able to execute your morning routine consistently and this will bring you no results but frustration. Be realistic about your schedule. Think of the days when you woke up later than usual and you are late for a meeting. Are you going to complete all 21 steps of your morning routine?
Some experts would suggest that you must get up very early to have your perfect morning routine. At 5 a.m. or even earlier. This sounds logical. If you wake up earlier than other people you have some time when nobody disturbs you and there is a high chance you would be able to complete your perfect morning routine with 21 steps. While this approach can work for morning-type people that constitute a minority of the world population it can be not practical or even risky for people who are more active at late hours. So, unfortunately, there is no silver bullet for everyone when it comes to routines. If you want to reach a new level of productivity you need to design custom routines for yourself. This is a continuous process of finding products and behaviors that fit you best in the current period of your life.
Nevertheless, we recommend that you have a minimal morning routine that you execute no matter what happens. Even if you have a trans-Atlantic flight at 6 a.m. It should last under 10 minutes. Add to this routine no more than 10 actions that can be completed in less than a minute time frame. Examples of such actions could be:
1.	Make bed
It takes seconds to make the bed. No point to skip it if nobody is still sleeping in the bed.
2.	Clean your teeth
You can use mouthwash if it is available to save some time.
3.	Drink a glass of water
Usually, you are dehydrated when you wake up. Drinking a glass of water can be a good idea even if you have a limited amount of time.
4.	Taking pills
If your prescription pills allow you to take them in the morning it is a good idea to take them with a glass of water.
5.	Hairstyling
Use dry shampoo and other styling products to save time here.
6.	Makeup
Do your basic makeup.
7.	Use Antiperspirant
Costs just seconds, no point to skip.
8.	Apply cream or transdermal drugs.
9.	Logging your weight, pressure, or other vital health parameters
Your weight pressure and other body parameters can deviate when the day progresses. So, it is a good idea to make measurements during your morning routine.
10.	Sending a message
It is a good idea to send a message to the people you care about. Just wish them a good productive day!
These are the actions that cost little time but improve your day dramatically. For other beneficial actions that require more time, you can design separate routines and execute them right after your morning routine in case you have time. Or you can postpone them till the evening or even the next day. Just don’t postpone them till the next year! Although this system sounds more complicated than just training yourself to wake up at 5 a.m. It is not extreme and there are more chances you will be consistent with it.  To perfectly tune such a system, you will need some additional tools because it is more difficult to keep everything in your brain’s memory. Luckily, we live in a digital era, and you probably already have a smartphone to help you in this process. You can use simple note applications or even better-specialized applications such as YouRoutines and its analogs.
