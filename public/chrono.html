  <h3><strong>What Are Circadian Rhythms?</strong></h3>
  <p>Physical, mental and behavioural changes that occur during a 24-hour window are called circadian rhythms. These processes respond primarily to light and dark. The study of these rhythms is called <strong>Chronobiology</strong>. One example of a circadian rhythm is feeling sleepy at night and active in the morning.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  </figure>
  <h3><strong>What is a Circadian Pacemaker?</strong></h3>
  <p>A cluster of 20,000 neurons located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus present in the hypothalamus of the brain that controls the circadian cycle and affects physiological and behavioural rhythm occurring during a 24-hour window is called a <strong>circadian pacemaker</strong> or a <strong>circadian clock.&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Almost every cell and tissue of the body has its biological clock. All of these individual clocks are synched by the master clock called Circadian Pacemaker.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><strong>History of Circadian Pacemaker Discovery</strong></h3>
  <p>The first <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6138759/">observation</a> of the existence of a biological clock in organisms dates back to 1729. A French Astronomer Jean Jacques d&rsquo;Ortous de Marian placed a mimosa plant in a dark room with no access to light. He observed that the plant continued to unfold its leaves during the day and close them in the evening. He concluded that something inside the plant&apos;s biological systems must prompt this behaviour. These endogenous circadian rhythms were discovered in several organisms afterwards. But mechanisms responsible for causing these rhythms were hidden until the advent of mutation screening in Drosophila Melanogaster in which it was discovered that a change in a gene named period (<em>per</em>) changes periodic locomotive activity. More genes were discovered over time.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5204321/">breakthrough</a> occurred when specific lesions were applied to the suprachiasmatic nucleus of mice and they lost all circadian rhythms of their body including activity, feeding, and temperature. This experiment established the suprachiasmatic nucleus as the Circadian Pacemaker.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><strong>Processes Triggered By Circadian Clock</strong></h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Circadian rhythms impact essential functions occurring in our body.&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Release of hormones</li>
      <li>Eating and digestive habits</li>
      <li>Body temperature&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Sleep-wake cycle</li>
      <li>Cardiovascular health</li>
      <li>Glucose homeostasis</li>
      <li>Overall body metabolism</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Hence, circadian rhythms play a very important role in maintaining an overall healthy state and well-being. Long-term disruptions in the circadian cycle affect the natural processes and cause pathologies like obesity, damaged glucose tolerance, diabetes, mental disorders like depression and cancer progression. Short-term disruptions cause mood swings, loss of focus and fatigue.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><strong>What Can You Do About It?</strong></h3>
  <p>Have you ever noticed that your productivity and focus increase when you are sleeping and waking up at scheduled times, eating food at regular times and doing your other activities at the set time as well? So, setting up a daily routine helps in keeping the circadian rhythms stable and allows you to enjoy more focus, concentration, well-being and a generally improved quality of life.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><strong>Importance of Considering Circadian Rhythms While Setting Your Daily Routine</strong></h3>
  <p>Since circadian rhythms control a great deal of how our body functions at various points in the 24-hour window, we should take advantage of this information to set up a routine that helps us get the most out of our activities. For example, exercising at different times during the 24-hour window (morning, noon, evening) has different benefits and advantages. So, by applying the information on how circadian rhythms impact exercise outcomes, we can set up a workout routine more fitted for our goals instead of just winging it.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In short, setting up your daily routine without considering your circadian rhythm and the effects it has on your bodily functions at various points is like swinging a sword in a dark room and expecting it to hit the target.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Let&rsquo;s dive a little deeper into some of the necessary daily activities that should be scheduled according to the circadian rhythm.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div>
      <ul>
          <li>
              <h3><strong>Sleep-Wake Cycle:</strong></h3>
          </li>
      </ul>
  </div>
  <p>As we have established, the circadian pacemaker plays a role in managing the sleep-wake cycle and the factors such as schedule, bedtime routine and age also play a role.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Considering circadian rhythm, teenagers are more inclined towards sleeping in, so they are better served after longer rest periods before starting their day because they have more energy a little later in the day. But as you approach adulthood, the sleep cycle shifts backwards. Thus, adults have higher energy levels early in the morning. During the evening, there is an energy dip and it is a good time for a nap to replenish that energy and improve task performance.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div>
      <ul>
          <li>
              <h3><strong>Eating</strong>:</h3>
          </li>
      </ul>
  </div>
  <p>Studies have suggested that eating at certain times has health advantages. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13546783.2011.625663">Research</a> showed that the time of eating impacts the biological clock and hence if you are shifting your routine due to travelling or work, shift your eating habits. Reducing your eating window helps with obesity and meals before sleeping has negative impacts on the body.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div>
      <ul>
          <li>
              <h3><strong>Exercise</strong>:</h3>
          </li>
      </ul>
  </div>
  <p>Research has shown that exercise impacts and maintains the circadian rhythm. The body responds differently to exercise during different times of the day. Morning exercise causes more reduction in blood glucose levels than evening exercise. During evening or noon energy levels are higher than in the morning and thus, endurance is increased and people are less prone to injury. Yoga is best before sleeping because it further relaxes the body.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div>
      <ul>
          <li>
              <h3><strong>Mental Tasks:</strong></h3>
          </li>
      </ul>
  </div>
  <p>You are sharpest in the morning. So, it is better to tackle brainy tasks early in the morning. Attention levels are reduced following the meals and it makes you feel lazy. An interesting fact is that people are more creative when they are tired because the mind wanders into depths when it is tired. So you can keep your creative thinking for the tired parts of your days.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><strong>How To Synchronise Your Circadian Rhythm With Your Daily Life?</strong></h3>
  <p>Not everybody&rsquo;s biological clock is the same. Some people tend to experience more energy in late hours depending upon their sleep routines and other activities. If you feel like you are not in sync with your biological clock, here&rsquo;s what you can do</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Establish a sleep schedule.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Be patient. Getting used to new routines is not a one-day job.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Pay attention to your energy levels so that you can schedule your activities accordingly.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><strong>Take Away!</strong></h3>
  <p>You can be at your maximum productivity if your exogenous daily routine is in synchronisation with your endogenous biological clock. So, while planning your routine make sure that you are taking into account your circadian rhythms to have maximum productive benefits.&nbsp;</p>
